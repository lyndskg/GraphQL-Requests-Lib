# GraphQL-Requests-Lib

Time Estimate: Approximately 40-60 hours
Description: Design and implement a library that can send GraphQL queries, handle responses, and provide an easy-to-use interface for integrating GraphQL into your applications. 
Develop a library that enables sending GraphQL requests and processing the responses in C++. This project involves implementing the GraphQL protocol, including query construction, request execution, and response handling. It requires knowledge of GraphQL concepts and the ability to interface with HTTP or WebSocket protocols.
Clearly document your design choices, system architecture, and important implementation details. 
Discuss the challenges faced, the strategies employed to overcome them, and the reasoning behind your design decisions. 
Showcase your ability to analyze and debug issues effectively.
Getting Started: Familiarize yourself with the GraphQL specification and the basics of making GraphQL requests. 
Understand the GraphQL protocol, including schema definition, query language, and response format.
Study existing GraphQL libraries and clients to gain insights into their design and implementation.
Implement the necessary components to handle GraphQL queries and responses in your C++ library.
Explore existing GraphQL libraries in C++ for inspiration. 
Design and implement a library that abstracts away the complexities of working with GraphQL.
Programming Language: C++
Resources:
Online tutorials: 
"How to build a GraphQL server"

Optimization: Optimize the library for efficiency and speed when handling GraphQL requests and responses.
Implement techniques such as caching, query optimization, or parallel request processing.
 Measure and document the performance improvements achieved.
Documentation: Create a README file that explains the library's purpose, features, and usage. 
Document the library's API usage, supported features, and code examples to assist users.
Consider providing sample applications or tutorials that showcase the library's capabilities.
Provide code examples and document the library's API.
Consider writing technical documentation or blog posts to showcase your library and explain its benefits and usage.
